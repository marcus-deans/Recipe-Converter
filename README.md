This web app built using React will take a user search for a food item and search [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/)'s food database for recipes that fit those criteria. Users are also able to enter their own recipe and have the program adjust the recipe to the appropriate units. The final version of the app was deployed via Netlify and may be seen [here](https://awesome-goldberg-8afdfa.netlify.app).

This project provided greater familiarity with React and making use of Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and may be expanded in the future.
